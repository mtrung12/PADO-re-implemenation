    "test_responses = \"\"\"1.  **Comparative Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Emotion**\n",
    "        *   **Agreement:** Both explainers agree that the user expresses a broad spectrum of emotions, particularly positive ones, and shows enthusiasm for life and experiences. Both cite examples like \"well and festive,\" \"I love *PROPNAME*,\" \"excited for a weekend wedding adventure,\" \"awesome blanket fort,\" and the use of cheerful emoticons.\n",
    "        *   **Disagreement:** Explainer A emphasizes a \"palpable sense of wonder and delight\" and notes that even \"mild frustration\" is \"quickly overshadowed by an overarching adventurous and positive outlook.\" Explainer B highlights the \"broad spectrum of emotions\" including \"jealousy\" and \"jittery,\" contrasting this with its own \"stoic nature.\"\n",
    "        *   **Alignment with Text:** Both explainers align well with the text. Explainer A accurately captures the predominant positive and adventurous tone, while Explainer B effectively points out the range of emotions, including minor negative ones, which still indicates a willingness to feel and express.\n",
    "        *   **Depth, Detail, Evidence:** Explainer A offers a slightly more nuanced interpretation by focusing on the *overall balance* and *predominant positive outlook* despite minor frustrations, which is characteristic of high Openness. Explainer B provides strong evidence for the *breadth* of emotional expression. Both are strong, but Explainer A's interpretation of the emotional landscape feels a bit more integrated into the Openness construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Cognition**\n",
    "        *   **Agreement:** Both explainers agree that the user demonstrates a highly imaginative, curious, and intellectually engaged mind. Both cite \"designing a mausoleum,\" \"chased by veloceraptors,\" and \"always surprised at how many building materials are made from cyanide, formaldehyde, and uric acid\" as evidence.\n",
    "        *   **Disagreement:** Explainer A further includes \"eccentric 3D models\" and interprets \"prioritizes the human over the applied, with mixed results\" as indicative of a \"philosophical and values-driven cognitive style.\" Explainer B broadly categorizes these as \"creative thinking, philosophical reflection, intellectual curiosity, and a fascination with unusual facts and concepts,\" contrasting this with its own \"lack of imagination and limited intellectual interests.\"\n",
    "        *   **Alignment with Text:** Both explainers show excellent alignment with the text, using direct and compelling examples to support their claims of imagination, curiosity, and intellectual engagement.\n",
    "        *   **Depth, Detail, Evidence:** Explainer A provides slightly more detailed interpretations of specific phrases, such as linking \"prioritizes the human over the applied\" to a \"philosophical and values-driven cognitive style,\" which adds a layer of depth to the cognitive analysis. Explainer B is also strong in its direct identification of cognitive traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Sociality**\n",
    "        *   **Agreement:** Both explainers agree that the user is socially engaged and enjoys shared experiences, often linked to novel activities. Both cite examples like \"wedding,\" \"birthday wishes,\" \"thanksgiving potluck,\" \"birthday dinner,\" \"rockin' out with siblings,\" and \"amazing people.\"\n",
    "        *   **Disagreement:** Explainer A frames sociality as contributing to a \"holistic openness to life\" and embracing a \"full spectrum of human experiences,\" even including the observation of a \"bassoonist\" as part of this broad engagement. Explainer B frames sociality as \"part of their adventurous and varied life,\" contrasting it with its own \"preference for staying in the background.\"\n",
    "        *   **Alignment with Text:** Both explainers align well with the text, effectively using examples of social interactions and events.\n",
    "        *   **Depth, Detail, Evidence:** Explainer A's framing of sociality as part of a \"holistic openness\" feels slightly more integrated into the broader trait of Openness, suggesting that social engagement is another avenue through which the user explores and experiences the world. Explainer B clearly identifies the social engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Overall Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both explainers reach the same conclusion that the user exhibits **High Openness**. However, Explainer A's overall analysis provides more comprehensive insights and stronger supporting evidence. Explainer A consistently delves deeper into the *implications* of the textual evidence, linking specific phrases and observations to the nuanced facets of Openness (e.g., \"philosophical and values-driven cognitive style,\" \"holistic openness,\" \"overarching adventurous and positive outlook\"). Its interpretations are more integrative, painting a richer and more detailed picture of how the user's Openness manifests across emotions, cognitions, and social interactions. While Explainer B effectively uses contrast to highlight the user's high Openness, Explainer A's direct and detailed interpretations offer a more thorough and insightful explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Final Judgement**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **High**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The user's trait is **High Openness**. This is strongly supported by the text, which consistently demonstrates a vivid imagination (\"chased by veloceraptors,\" \"designing a mausoleum\"), a broad range of intellectual and aesthetic interests (\"watching the Perseid meteor shower,\" \"always surprised at how many building materials are made from cyanide,\" \"eccentric 3D models\"), a clear love for adventure and novel experiences (\"weekend wedding adventure,\" \"drifting down the Huron,\" \"crazy Canadian adventure,\" \"hitchhiking\"), and a rich expression of varied emotions, often positive and enthusiastic. The user's curiosity, creativity, and eagerness to engage with diverse aspects of life—from natural phenomena to social gatherings and philosophical reflections—are all hallmarks of high Openness.\n",
