Text: back in cali!!!

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
   - The text "back in cali!!!" conveys a sense of excitement and positive emotion. The use of exclamation marks suggests enthusiasm and happiness about being back in California. This positive emotional expression aligns with traits of high extraversion, as extraverted individuals often display cheerful and optimistic emotions.

2. Cognition
   - While the text is brief and does not provide much insight into cognitive processes, the decision to share this update suggests a level of active engagement with one's environment. The excitement about returning to a familiar place like California might indicate a preference for stimulating and dynamic experiences, which is a cognitive trait often associated with extraversion.

3. Sociality
   - The text implies a connection to a social context, as the writer feels compelled to share their location update with others. This suggests a desire for social interaction and communication, which are key aspects of extraversion. The use of "back" implies a return to a place where the writer likely has social ties or experiences, further emphasizing their social nature.

Overall, the writer seems to exhibit traits similar to mine in terms of extraversion, displaying enthusiasm, a preference for engaging environments, and a desire for social interaction.

Text: back in cali!!!

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
   - The use of exclamation marks and the phrase "back in cali!!!" suggests a high level of excitement and positive emotion. This indicates a more extraverted personality, as extraverts often express their emotions outwardly and with enthusiasm, unlike my more reserved and subdued emotional expression.

2. Cognition
   - The text does not provide much in terms of cognitive engagement or complex reasoning. The focus is on an immediate emotional reaction rather than a thoughtful analysis or reflection, which aligns more with extraverted tendencies to act on impulse and express immediate feelings rather than introspective thought.

3. Sociality
   - The phrase "back in cali" implies a connection to a place that may hold social significance, such as friends or family, suggesting a desire for social interaction or a return to a familiar social environment. This contrasts with my preference for solitude and minimal social engagement, indicating a more extraverted orientation.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text contains minimal emotional expression, with the exception of the ":D" emoticon, which suggests a hint of positive emotion or amusement. This limited emotional content indicates a more neutral or subdued emotional tone, which might suggest a personality that is less focused on expressing emotions openly compared to someone who is highly extraverted and emotionally expressive like myself.

2. Cognition
- The text includes elements that suggest a focus on academic and intellectual topics, such as "Research Area" and "Tentative Examination Schedule." This indicates a cognitive engagement with structured and possibly complex topics, which can be characteristic of someone who is thoughtful and detail-oriented. However, this does not directly correlate with extraversion, as cognitive engagement can be present in both introverted and extraverted individuals.

3. Sociality
- The text lacks explicit references to social interactions or connections with others. There are no mentions of communication with people, social activities, or relational terms, which suggests a lower emphasis on sociality in this particular context. This absence of social content might indicate a personality that is less socially oriented or expressive in written communication, contrasting with a highly social and gregarious personality like mine.

Overall, based on the text provided, the writer seems to exhibit traits that are less aligned with high extraversion, particularly in terms of emotional expression and sociality. They might be more reserved or focused on individual intellectual pursuits, which is somewhat opposite to my own extraverted nature.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text does not convey clear emotional expressions. The presence of random sequences of letters and symbols suggests a lack of emotional engagement or expression. This absence of emotional language indicates a neutral or subdued emotional state, which aligns more closely with introverted tendencies, as introverts often express emotions less overtly.

2. Cognition
- The text includes references to academic and intellectual topics, such as "Research Area: Regional Economic Integration" and "cartography+Select. Topics in the Geography of China." This suggests an engagement with cognitive processes and intellectual interests. However, the scattered nature of the text, with random letters and symbols, might indicate a disorganized or distracted cognitive state. This could imply a preference for solitary intellectual pursuits, which is more characteristic of introversion.

3. Sociality
- There is a noticeable absence of social language or references to interactions with others in the text. The focus is on academic and technical content, with no mention of social relationships or communication. This lack of social references suggests a low level of social engagement, which is typical of introverted individuals who may prefer solitary activities over social interactions.

Overall, the text suggests that the writer may share some introverted traits, similar to my own, particularly in terms of emotional expression and social engagement.

  a) Agreement: Both explainers agree that the text shows minimal emotional expression. Explainer A notes the absence of emotional language, while Explainer B highlights the presence of a ":D" emoticon as a hint of positive emotion.
  b) Alignment: Explainer B's mention of the ":D" emoticon aligns better with the text, as it acknowledges the only explicit emotional cue present.
  c) Depth and Evidence: Explainer B provides slightly more depth by identifying the emoticon as an emotional indicator, whereas Explainer A overlooks this detail.

- Cognition:
  a) Agreement: Both explainers recognize the text's focus on academic and intellectual topics, such as "Research Area" and "cartography."
  b) Alignment: Both analyses align well with the text, as they both identify the academic references.
  c) Depth and Evidence: Explainer A suggests a disorganized cognitive state due to random letters and symbols, providing a more nuanced interpretation. Explainer B focuses on cognitive engagement but does not link it to personality traits as directly.

  a) Agreement: Both explainers agree on the absence of social language or references to interactions with others.
  b) Alignment: Both analyses align well with the text, as there are no social references.
  c) Depth and Evidence: Explainer A connects the lack of social references to introversion, providing a clearer link to personality traits. Explainer B contrasts this with their own extraverted nature but does not delve as deeply into the implications.

2. Overall Evaluation

- Explainer A provides a more comprehensive analysis by linking the elements of emotion, cognition, and sociality to introverted traits. Explainer B offers some insights, particularly in recognizing the emoticon, but does not connect the cognitive and social elements as effectively to personality traits.

3. Final Judgement

- Low Extraversion (High Introversion): Based on Explainer A's stronger analysis, the user's text suggests traits associated with introversion, such as subdued emotional expression, solitary intellectual pursuits, and low social engagement.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions  
- The text exhibits a mix of positive and negative emotions. The writer expresses excitement and anticipation about participating in the CrossFit games, which indicates a positive and enthusiastic outlook. Phrases like "Life is good" and "Not bad" suggest an optimistic attitude. However, there is also a moment of negativity when the writer feels "aweful" and is concerned about getting sick, which shows some emotional variability. Overall, the presence of strong positive emotions suggests a tendency towards extraversion, as extraverts often experience and express positive emotions more frequently.

2. Cognition  
- The text reflects active cognitive engagement, especially in the context of planning and goal-setting, as seen in the anticipation of the CrossFit games. The writer also demonstrates reflective thinking by clarifying the nature of the CrossFit workout, indicating an awareness of how their words might be perceived by others. This level of cognitive engagement aligns with extraverted individuals who often enjoy dynamic and stimulating environments that challenge their thinking.

3. Sociality  
- The writer frequently references social activities and interactions, such as participating in CrossFit, making money in Vegas, and working long hours. These activities suggest a high level of engagement with the external world and a preference for environments that involve social interaction. The use of humor and the clarification about the CrossFit workout further indicate a desire to communicate effectively and maintain social connections. This emphasis on sociality is characteristic of extraverted individuals who thrive in social settings.

Overall, the writer's personality appears to be similar to mine in terms of extraversion, as they exhibit a cheerful outlook, active engagement in social activities, and a positive emotional tone.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text displays a range of emotions, from excitement and anticipation regarding Crossfit achievements and financial success in Vegas, to frustration and anger about feeling unwell. The intensity of these emotions, particularly the excitement and frustration, suggests a person who experiences emotions vividly and is not afraid to express them. This contrasts with my own tendency to be more subdued and less expressive emotionally.

2. Cognition
- The text reflects active cognitive engagement, particularly in the context of goal-setting and achievement (e.g., preparing for the Crossfit games, managing work commitments). The writer seems to be focused on problem-solving and planning, which indicates a proactive and dynamic cognitive style. This is somewhat different from my own more passive and contemplative approach to cognition.

3. Sociality
- The text includes references to social activities and interactions, such as participating in Crossfit, making money in Vegas, and clarifying jokes for the audience. The use of humor and the anticipation of social judgment (e.g., "Save the sex joke") suggest a person who is socially aware and engaged, enjoying interactions with others. This is in contrast to my preference for solitude and limited social engagement.

Overall, the writer appears to be more extraverted than I am, displaying a higher level of emotional expressiveness, cognitive engagement, and social interaction.

2. Cognition
- The text reflects active cognitive engagement, particularly in the context of goal-setting and achievement (e.g., preparing for the Crossfit games, managing work commitments). The writer seems to be focused on problem-solving and planning, which indicates a proactive and dynamic cognitive style. This is somewhat different from my own more passive and contemplative approach to cognition.

3. Sociality
- The text includes references to social activities and interactions, such as participating in Crossfit, making money in Vegas, and clarifying jokes for the audience. The use of humor and the anticipation of social judgment (e.g., "Save the sex joke") suggest a person who is socially aware and engaged, enjoying interactions with others. This is in contrast to my preference for solitude and limited social engagement.

Overall, the writer appears to be more extraverted than I am, displaying a higher level of emotional expressiveness, cognitive engagement, and social interaction.
Explainer B: **Extraversion**

1. Emotions  
- The text exhibits a mix of positive and negative emotions. The writer expresses excitement and anticipation about participating in the CrossFit games, which indicates a positive and enthusiastic outlook. Phrases like "Life is good" and "Not bad" suggest an optimistic attitude. However, there is also a moment of negativity when the writer feels "aweful" and is concerned about getting sick, which shows some emotional variability. Overall, the presence of strong positive emotions suggests a tendency towards extraversion, as extraverts often experience and express positive emotions more frequently.

2. Cognition  
- The text reflects active cognitive engagement, especially in the context of planning and goal-setting, as seen in the anticipation of the CrossFit games. The writer also demonstrates reflective thinking by clarifying the nature of the CrossFit workout, indicating an awareness of how their words might be perceived by others. This level of cognitive engagement aligns with extraverted individuals who often enjoy dynamic and stimulating environments that challenge their thinking.

3. Sociality  
- The writer frequently references social activities and interactions, such as participating in CrossFit, making money in Vegas, and working long hours. These activities suggest a high level of engagement with the external world and a preference for environments that involve social interaction. The use of humor and the clarification about the CrossFit workout further indicate a desire to communicate effectively and maintain social connections. This emphasis on sociality is characteristic of extraverted individuals who thrive in social settings.

Overall, the writer's personality appears to be similar to mine in terms of extraversion, as they exhibit a cheerful outlook, active engagement in social activities, and a positive emotional tone.

- The text is rich in social interactions, mentioning family, shopping with kids, and gratitude for babysitting. The frequent references to others and shared activities suggest a high level of social engagement, which aligns with extraversion. In contrast, I prefer solitude and minimal social interaction, highlighting a difference in sociality.

Overall, the user appears to be more extraverted than I am, as indicated by their emotional expressiveness, active cognition, and social engagement.

Text: It's time I fire up this life I'm livin' in!

Cuando la vida misma te ha puesto en un aprieto, ¿qué es lo que se debe hacer?

Que es lo que en realidad se debe de hacer? Lo que el corazón dicta o lo que la razon te dice?

Es momento de aprender a dejar ir las cosas. Por favor, que aquella luz, guía mía, me lleve a los lugares indicados.

Oscilando entre la infinidad de la mente y la infinidad del sueño...

Hay veces en las que simplemente quisiera olvidarme de todo y refugiarme en la profundidad de mi mente...

Meus somnerium... En busca de un pequeño momento de comprensión...

De vuelta al mundo interno sin límites!

Por favor, que las cosas mejoren! Si es que en verdad alguien puede ayudar, que le otorguen lo que necesita!

Getting ready for the fun! Escapada espiritual al corazón del oráculo... Riviera Maya! Meus somnierum!

I want to reconcile the violence in your heart! I want to recognise your beauty is not just a mask! I want to exorcise the demons from your past! I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart! (Gracias a Sofi por la canción tan genial!)

I just... Don't know what to think anymore...

Life truly has special ways to show us what we need... in the weirdest moments////f i n a l f a n t a s y////"I know. I'm not alone... not anymore."

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text is rich with emotional expressions, ranging from a desire for fun and excitement ("Getting ready for the fun!") to moments of introspection and longing ("Por favor, que las cosas mejoren!"). The writer shows a mix of positive and negative emotions, indicating a complex emotional landscape. While there is optimism and a search for joy, there are also hints of struggle and introspection, which might suggest a more introverted tendency compared to my own consistently cheerful and optimistic outlook.

2. Cognition
- The text reveals a deep engagement with cognitive processes, as seen in the writer's contemplation of life's challenges and decisions ("¿qué es lo que se debe hacer?"). The writer is actively reasoning and reflecting on the balance between heart and reason, and the pursuit of understanding ("En busca de un pequeño momento de comprensión..."). This level of introspection and intellectual engagement suggests a thoughtful and reflective personality, which might lean towards introversion, as it contrasts with my more action-oriented and experience-seeking nature.

3. Sociality
- Social elements are present but not predominant in the text. The writer mentions gratitude towards a friend for a song ("Gracias a Sofi por la canción tan genial!") and acknowledges not being alone anymore, which indicates some level of social connection. However, much of the text focuses on internal experiences and personal reflections, suggesting a more solitary or introspective approach to sociality. This contrasts with my highly social and gregarious nature, indicating a possible difference in extraversion levels.

Overall, the writer appears to have a more introverted personality compared to my own extroverted nature, as they exhibit a strong focus on introspection, emotional complexity, and cognitive engagement.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text reflects a wide range of emotions, from a desire for excitement ("fire up this life") to introspection and longing for guidance ("Por favor, que aquella luz, guía mía, me lleve a los lugares indicados"). The presence of both positive and negative emotions suggests a complex emotional landscape. The intensity of emotions expressed, such as the plea for improvement and the desire to reconcile inner conflicts, indicates a person who experiences emotions deeply. This emotional depth could be associated with both introverted and extroverted individuals, but the introspective nature of the emotions leans slightly towards introversion.

2. Cognition
- The text shows a high level of cognitive engagement, with questions about following the heart versus reason and reflections on learning to let go. The writer oscillates between the mind and dreams, indicating active intellectual engagement and introspection. This cognitive complexity suggests a person who spends considerable time in thought and reflection, which is more characteristic of introversion.

3. Sociality
- Social elements in the text are present but not dominant. There is a mention of gratitude towards a friend ("Gracias a Sofi por la canción tan genial!") and a recognition of not being alone anymore. However, much of the text focuses on internal experiences and personal reflections rather than social interactions. This suggests a preference for solitary contemplation over social engagement, aligning more closely with introversion.

Overall, the writer appears to share some similarities with my introversive nature, particularly in terms of cognition and sociality, indicating a tendency towards introspection and a preference for internal experiences over external social interactions.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text is filled with expressions of positive emotions, such as excitement ("super stoked," "absolutely adores life"), love ("<3's my friends," "love my lunch"), and optimism ("sometimes dreams do come true," "life will believe in you"). These emotional expressions suggest a cheerful and optimistic outlook, similar to my own personality. The frequent use of emoticons and exclamations further indicates a high level of emotional expressiveness, which is often associated with extraversion.

2. Cognition
- The text shows active cognitive engagement through the mention of learning new skills (e.g., "wants to learn how to make French macaroons," "really wants to take French and Arabic"), problem-solving (e.g., "trying to figure out my next travel plans"), and intellectual curiosity (e.g., "debate philosophy over bottles of wine"). This cognitive engagement reflects a lively and inquisitive mind, which aligns with an extraverted personality that thrives on new experiences and intellectual stimulation.

3. Sociality
- Sociality is highly evident in the text, with numerous references to social interactions and relationships ("convinced just about everyone in the office to go to happy hour," "loves all my friends"). The writer frequently mentions spending time with others, organizing events, and seeking companionship ("anyone want to sublease my pretty North Beach studio," "who wants to join me for Halloween in NYC?"). This strong emphasis on social connections and activities suggests a high level of extraversion, much like my own preference for being around others and engaging in social experiences.

In conclusion, the person who wrote the text appears to be quite similar to me in terms of extraversion. They exhibit a high level of emotional expressiveness, cognitive engagement, and sociality, all of which are characteristic of an extraverted personality.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text is filled with a wide range of emotions, from excitement and love to frustration and sadness. The frequent use of positive emoticons like "<3" and expressions of excitement and love for life indicate a generally positive emotional outlook. This suggests a person who is emotionally expressive and experiences emotions intensely, which is more characteristic of an extroverted personality. In contrast, my own personality is more reserved and less emotionally expressive.

2. Cognition
- The text reflects active cognitive engagement, with the author frequently contemplating decisions, reflecting on experiences, and expressing curiosity about various topics. The mention of re-evaluating, planning travel, and considering different life paths indicates a thoughtful and intellectually engaged individual. This level of cognitive activity aligns with an extroverted personality, which often involves active engagement with the world, whereas my cognitive processes are more introspective and deliberate.

3. Sociality
- The text is highly social, with numerous references to interactions with friends, coworkers, and family. The author frequently mentions social activities, such as parties, travel with friends, and communal experiences. This strong emphasis on social connections and interactions is indicative of an extroverted personality, which contrasts with my preference for solitude and limited social engagement.

Overall, the person who wrote the text appears to be quite different from me in terms of extraversion. They exhibit traits of an extroverted personality, characterized by emotional expressiveness, active cognitive engagement, and a strong focus on social interactions.

Explainer A: **Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text is filled with expressions of positive emotions, such as excitement ("super stoked," "absolutely adores life"), love ("<3's my friends," "love my lunch"), and optimism ("sometimes dreams do come true," "life will believe in you"). These emotional expressions suggest a cheerful and optimistic outlook, similar to my own personality. The frequent use of emoticons and exclamations further indicates a high level of emotional expressiveness, which is often associated with extraversion.

2. Cognition
- The text shows active cognitive engagement through the mention of learning new skills (e.g., "wants to learn how to make French macaroons," "really wants to take French and Arabic"), problem-solving (e.g., "trying to figure out my next travel plans"), and intellectual curiosity (e.g., "debate philosophy over bottles of wine"). This cognitive engagement reflects a lively and inquisitive mind, which aligns with an extraverted personality that thrives on new experiences and intellectual stimulation.

3. Sociality
- Sociality is highly evident in the text, with numerous references to social interactions and relationships ("convinced just about everyone in the office to go to happy hour," "loves all my friends"). The writer frequently mentions spending time with others, organizing events, and seeking companionship ("anyone want to sublease my pretty North Beach studio," "who wants to join me for Halloween in NYC?"). This strong emphasis on social connections and activities suggests a high level of extraversion, much like my own preference for being around others and engaging in social experiences.

In conclusion, the person who wrote the text appears to be quite similar to me in terms of extraversion. They exhibit a high level of emotional expressiveness, cognitive engagement, and sociality, all of which are characteristic of an extraverted personality.
Explainer B: **Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text is filled with a wide range of emotions, from excitement and love to frustration and sadness. The frequent use of positive emoticons like "<3" and expressions of excitement and love for life indicate a generally positive emotional outlook. This suggests a person who is emotionally expressive and experiences emotions intensely, which is more characteristic of an extroverted personality. In contrast, my own personality is more reserved and less emotionally expressive.

2. Cognition
- The text reflects active cognitive engagement, with the author frequently contemplating decisions, reflecting on experiences, and expressing curiosity about various topics. The mention of re-evaluating, planning travel, and considering different life paths indicates a thoughtful and intellectually engaged individual. This level of cognitive activity aligns with an extroverted personality, which often involves active engagement with the world, whereas my cognitive processes are more introspective and deliberate.

3. Sociality
- The text is highly social, with numerous references to interactions with friends, coworkers, and family. The author frequently mentions social activities, such as parties, travel with friends, and communal experiences. This strong emphasis on social connections and interactions is indicative of an extroverted personality, which contrasts with my preference for solitude and limited social engagement.

Overall, the person who wrote the text appears to be quite different from me in terms of extraversion. They exhibit traits of an extroverted personality, characterized by emotional expressiveness, active cognitive engagement, and a strong focus on social interactions.

Text: Was stuck between reality and a dream...unpleasant.

Let's go to Italia~~

Is going back to the homeland

"Oh my God dude, doing 5 tomorrow is going to feel like sex!" --*PROPNAME*

Asleep with open eyes.

The love of my life: repeat 800s on a sunny day.

"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment." --Buddha

Driving to nowhere. Accompanied only by the pitter-patters of rain on my windshield.

"We Americans think you have to accomplish everything quickly. We're the country of thirty-minute lunches and two-minute football drill...[we need to] slow down and make building relationships as important as building projects."  --*PROPNAME*

I declare myself a mercenary. Have a job? I'll get it done.

...wow...

Is back

38 miles last week, more this week, lifting despite the soar screeches on my muscles. My body hates me right now...

It might be time for one last great adventure, a minimum 13 hour plane ride away.

My cat squeaks when he stretches.

Feeling Hypnotized.

There's just something about those cold winter nights.

Born three times.

This year, and especially fall has definitely established a theme for itself. Seriously Higher Being, watching a dark comedy may be fun for you, but I can assure you that living it is an entirely opposite experience.

Goals for the next 11 months: (1) Rock the fuck out of the LSAT (2) Run under 3 in the marathon (3) Get into a baller law school (4) Buy a BMW Z4 (5) Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia anyone???

Just ran 18 miles....

My new philosophy: study and get ripped. Fuck everything and everyone else.

Marathon in a few days O_O.

Thanks for the support guys! We did it.

"Sit back and curiously observe the ride. You're not going to enjoy it, but it is going to take you somewhere." --Me under the inspiration of some lost muse.

Long long long day

Going running down a trail of bright oranges and yellows.

Pop Rocks are the shit.

Yay for adventures.

A little tanner, great times, and now very current on hip-hop.

Thanks for all the birthday love everyone!

Had a ridiculous time in Holland with his boys *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*. Now he needs some shoes, some finances and a hike up the highest mountain in Poland.

Is in Holland baby!

Real Talk.

Found a feather sticking out of his Wendy's chicken nugget....at least now we know it's made from a bird right?

I guess there's still some hope. A stranger helped me out today.

Saw a shooting star on number seven of eight 800s.

In a cafe...again, doin what I always do.

1. Emotions
- The text displays a wide range of emotions, from excitement ("Yay for adventures," "Pop Rocks are the shit") to frustration ("My body hates me right now," "living it is an entirely opposite experience"). The presence of both positive and negative emotions, along with expressions of intensity ("rock the fuck out of the LSAT"), suggests a person who is emotionally expressive and experiences emotions vividly. This emotional expressiveness is more characteristic of an extraverted personality, which contrasts with my own introverted nature that tends to be more reserved and less expressive.

2. Cognition
- The text shows evidence of active cognitive engagement, with references to planning and goal-setting ("Goals for the next 11 months," "study and get ripped"), as well as philosophical reflections ("Do not dwell in the past..."). This indicates a person who is intellectually engaged and thoughtful, which can be a trait of both introverted and extraverted individuals. However, the dynamic and goal-oriented nature of the cognitive processes described leans more towards an extraverted approach, which is more action-oriented compared to my more passive and contemplative style.

3. Sociality
- The text is rich in social references, mentioning interactions with friends ("Had a ridiculous time in Holland with his boys"), expressions of gratitude ("Thanks for the support guys!"), and shared experiences ("Thanks for all the birthday love everyone!"). This high level of social engagement and appreciation for social interactions is indicative of an extraverted personality, which is quite different from my preference for solitude and minimal social interaction.

Overall, the person who wrote the text appears to be more extraverted compared to my introverted personality. They exhibit emotional expressiveness, active cognitive engagement, and a strong inclination towards social interactions, all of which are traits commonly associated with extraversion.

wonders whether anyone's ever done an etymological history of onomatopoeia.  Why did "oink" become so popular when most pigs I've seen go "reeee"?  Why did "fap" become so popular?  Is it accuracy or something else?  A most interesting question...  Any linguistics majors in need of a paper topic?

never gives up, never surrenders!

has finally ended orientation!  That was fast...  Perspectives in Social Science, Historical Methods, and Early Modern England will be my classes this quarter, it seems.

gave up on being a productive member of society when he left engineering, OK Social Sciences?  Just let me write about cool people.  I don't want to think about how my topic benefits anyone.

loves Holst oh so much.

PONY!

feels like a koala crapped a rainbow in his brain!

gazed upon the face of the Savior of the Monkeys and wept from the beauty of the sight.

is done with the MAPSS midterm and much happier because of it.

thinks he'll apply to Pigfarts for next year.

leaves for Chicago tomorrow.  Can't wait!  Now if only the magical packing fairy would visit me...

associates Russian classical composers with Christmas, for some reason.  Not just the Nutcracker stuff, either.  It's a bit odd...  Especially since everyone knows Santa lives in Finland, not Russia.

just found out Megas XLR is on iTunes!  Life just got a little bit more awesome.

is ready to begin his day fueled with the power of french toast!  Readings: prepare to be read...

has too many unknowns to solve his equations, but he'll never stop trying.

digs giant robots.

Dear everyone: crack open a dictionary and start using "hypothesis" and "theory" correctly from now on.  It's not that hard, and misusing the word confuses stupid people to whom I then need to listen, which makes me sad.  : (

lernas Esperanton!

has chourico!  The tastiest, most delicious meat known to mankind!  And I'm going to eat the crap out of it!

amas lerni novaj lingvoj!

is thankful for all his wonderful friends!  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!  I wish I could spend it with every one of you.

Alright Holst, listen up.  I'm going to see your music tomorrow and I don't want anything supernatural to prevent it, got it?  I'm sick of your crap.

danced again last night.  This is starting to become a pattern...

remembers a time when he was able to easily find classes because the school actually had its shit together and managed to have a central location with all the course descriptions.

Good morning!  And in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!

reads from his past and mourns the future.

"I love her better than anybody here, and see her seldomer.  So it often happens in the world."-*PROPNAME*

has finished his skeleton drafts, hooray!  Suck it, essays!

HAL is alive once again!  Just in time for 2010, conveniently enough.  Not sure if I'm gonna keep him, cuz he's now missing MS Word, but eh, he has internet.

s ganache is delicious.

Dear Online Dictionary Makers, Let people search the text of the entries, not just the entry words.  Make your dictionaries more like a human brain.  Let me search "make things the same" and find words that include those words in their definitions.  That would rock. Love, *PROPNAME*

I have enemies?  I thought these things always just happened...

feels weird being in the library during Finals Week as a patron...

Holy crap this is hilarious: http:////www.standforchristmas.com//pages//home Just read these reviews.  What bigoted morons think like this?  Read the "Offensive" ones.  They're the best.

is starting to wonder whether his eyes reflect light in the near-infrared spectrum or something that's just out of sight for humans but visible to cameras, cuz man, if I only had photos to go by I would swear my eyes are red.

And now all I have to do is pack!  Hooray!  One quarter down, two to go!

is filling his diaries with references to dinosaurs and Bigfoot.  This way, when the world ends and future historians have only my diary for primary sources, they'll think that at least the world was awesome before it ended.  If you care about tricking the future into believing our era was the awesomest ever, I encourage you to do the same.  Together, we can do it!

I'm home, wheee!

One paper submitted, two to go.

RIP HAL 9000...  I think your successor will be named Metal Gear.

has the most melodramatic sister in the world...

just got his mind blown.  Apparently *PROPNAME* from Salute Your Shorts, the rich girl, was played by a Chinese-American actress.  I totally never noticed that.  Ever.  Thank you, www.tvtropes.org for once again, showing that I have a terrible memory.

is beginning to miss Chicago and his friends there...

dreads his mortality as he walks the empty aisles of a library, admiring the volumes, yet knowing his life will never last long enough for him to enjoy them all.

Let's see how honest MY FB friends are. Leave a one word comment that you think best describes me. It can only be one word. No more than one word. Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you. This should be interesting...

wants to get out of Hyde Park.

wants to be the very best!  Like no one ever was!

A bit of Christmas cuteness: http:////www.watchanimeon.com//axis-powers-hetalia-ii-episode-28//

should just become a chef.

wonders whether love can bloom, even on a battlefield.

Merry Christmas, everyone!

Well crap.  My computer's software is currently corrupted or something and won't work.  Right before my two Hell Weeks begin.  Wheeee...  Anyone in Chicago have a copy of their Windows XP Professional edition CD I can borrow to reinstall stuff?

Is back in Chicago!

s New Year's Resolution is to negate everyone else's resolutions.

27F, feels like 14F....Ah!  It's like being in Ithaca again!  It feels wonderful!  And yes, *PROPNAME*, I am crazy.

Just did the research and writing for his 12 page term paper in 48 hours.  Revision time!

All three of my sidebar ads are currently about meeting girls.  I think Facebook pities me...  :(

returns to Chicago tomorrow!  Yay!

First day of classes for a new quarter!  I hope no suddenly loud girls give me coronary thrombosis like last quarter...

has the same Spring Break as *PROPNAME*!  If any Cornellians want a super awesome place to visit during their Spring Break, keep Chicago in mind...

has a few excellent weekends coming up.  Rock on!

Happy 150th Birthday, Mr Zamenhof!  Thanks for the language!

The Portuguese pronounce X like SH?  Damnit, is it THEIR fault Romanized Chinese does the same?  I always wondered who to blame for that.

wonders whether Professor *PROPNAME* would let him write a term paper on fanfictions using theories from the readings...

Welche bluse magst du lieber, diese oder diese?

Holy mother microfilm is a bitch on the eyes.  Dear 1890, learn to write normal Ms and Ns.  Yours look like Ws and Us.

Come on Massachusetts!  You guys are supposed to be New English!  What happened?

Anyone wanna see The Fly on Wednesday?  It'll be awesome...

just had a great day.

Geez 18th Century Britons, if you love *PROPNAME* the Great so much, why don't you just marry him?

Holy crap!  Hiero II of Syracuse was a former general of Pyrrhus of Epirus!  I never knew that!  Hiero has the official title of Awesomest Friendhaver in the Ancient World now, so far as I'm concerned.  Pyrrhus and Archimedes, at least!  Go Hiero!  You're MY hero!

Can't wait for next weekend, even if he is getting evaluated!

You can ask me one question (Send it to my inbox). Any question- anything. No matter how awkward it can be I'll answer it honestly, no catch. But, I dare you to put this as your status and see what people ask you.  (I can't resist dares...)

Off to the art museum!  Sorry Proposal, I'll work on you later...probably...

Whutta whutta whutta whutta...

wishes a Happy Valentine's Day to all those for whom he cares!  I hope all my friends know how much they mean to me!

Is looking forward to the weekend.

Is off to see *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*!  And I got an awesome gift in the mail today!  And I learned how to construct a book wheel.  Today is just, like, mega-awesome!

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text is filled with expressions of positive emotions, such as excitement, happiness, and enthusiasm ("can't help but smile," "had a dream come true," "is thankful for all his wonderful friends!"). There are also instances of negative emotions, such as frustration and sadness ("is sad the weekend is here," "dreads his mortality"). The frequent use of emotional language suggests that the person is comfortable expressing their feelings openly, which is more characteristic of an extraverted personality.

2. Cognition
- The text demonstrates active cognitive engagement, with references to problem-solving, intellectual curiosity, and reflection ("wonders whether anyone's ever done an etymological history of onomatopoeia," "is one iteration closer to his desired solution"). The person seems to enjoy thinking deeply about various topics and sharing these thoughts, indicating a high level of cognitive activity. This intellectual engagement is not necessarily tied to extraversion or introversion but suggests a thoughtful and curious nature.

3. Sociality
- The text contains numerous references to social interactions and relationships ("wishes everyone a happy first day of classes," "wants to thank the Tabasco company for listing the Scoville Heat Units of its products"). The frequent mentions of friends, social activities, and communication indicate a strong orientation towards social engagement, which is typical of an extraverted individual. The person appears to derive energy and satisfaction from social interactions, contrasting with my preference for solitude and background roles.

Overall, the person who wrote the text seems to exhibit traits more aligned with extraversion, given their emotional expressiveness, social engagement, and enthusiasm for shared experiences. This suggests that they are opposite to me in terms of extraversion.

Follow these steps to perform your analysis:
1. Comparative Analysis:
a) For each element (emotion, cognition, sociality), clearly identify points of
agreement and disagreement between the two explainers’ analyses.
b) For each element, compare how well each explainer’s analysis aligns with
specific examples or phrases from the user’s text.
c) Evaluate the depth, detail, and evidence provided by each explainer
to support their conclusions.
2. Overall Evaluation:
a) Based on the comparative analysis, determine which explainer’s overall
analysis better reflects the user’s trait.
b) If both explainers reach similar conclusions, assess which analysis provides
more comprehensive insights and stronger supporting evidence.
3. Final Judgement: Conclude whether the user’s trait is high or low, and briefly

gave up on being a productive member of society when he left engineering, OK Social Sciences?  Just let me write about cool people.  I don't want to think about how my topic benefits anyone.

loves Holst oh so much.

PONY!

feels like a koala crapped a rainbow in his brain!

gazed upon the face of the Savior of the Monkeys and wept from the beauty of the sight.

is done with the MAPSS midterm and much happier because of it.

thinks he'll apply to Pigfarts for next year.

leaves for Chicago tomorrow.  Can't wait!  Now if only the magical packing fairy would visit me...

associates Russian classical composers with Christmas, for some reason.  Not just the Nutcracker stuff, either.  It's a bit odd...  Especially since everyone knows Santa lives in Finland, not Russia.

just found out Megas XLR is on iTunes!  Life just got a little bit more awesome.

is ready to begin his day fueled with the power of french toast!  Readings: prepare to be read...

has too many unknowns to solve his equations, but he'll never stop trying.

digs giant robots.

Dear everyone: crack open a dictionary and start using "hypothesis" and "theory" correctly from now on.  It's not that hard, and misusing the word confuses stupid people to whom I then need to listen, which makes me sad.  : (

Alright Holst, listen up.  I'm going to see your music tomorrow and I don't want anything supernatural to prevent it, got it?  I'm sick of your crap.

danced again last night.  This is starting to become a pattern...

remembers a time when he was able to easily find classes because the school actually had its shit together and managed to have a central location with all the course descriptions.

Good morning!  And in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!

"I love her better than anybody here, and see her seldomer.  So it often happens in the world."-*PROPNAME*

has finished his skeleton drafts, hooray!  Suck it, essays!

HAL is alive once again!  Just in time for 2010, conveniently enough.  Not sure if I'm gonna keep him, cuz he's now missing MS Word, but eh, he has internet.

s ganache is delicious.

Dear Online Dictionary Makers, Let people search the text of the entries, not just the entry words.  Make your dictionaries more like a human brain.  Let me search "make things the same" and find words that include those words in their definitions.  That would rock. Love, *PROPNAME*

I have enemies?  I thought these things always just happened...

feels weird being in the library during Finals Week as a patron...

Holy crap this is hilarious: http:////www.standforchristmas.com//pages//home Just read these reviews.  What bigoted morons think like this?  Read the "Offensive" ones.  They're the best.

is starting to wonder whether his eyes reflect light in the near-infrared spectrum or something that's just out of sight for humans but visible to cameras, cuz man, if I only had photos to go by I would swear my eyes are red.

And now all I have to do is pack!  Hooray!  One quarter down, two to go!

is filling his diaries with references to dinosaurs and Bigfoot.  This way, when the world ends and future historians have only my diary for primary sources, they'll think that at least the world was awesome before it ended.  If you care about tricking the future into believing our era was the awesomest ever, I encourage you to do the same.  Together, we can do it!

I'm home, wheee!

One paper submitted, two to go.

RIP HAL 9000...  I think your successor will be named Metal Gear.

is beginning to miss Chicago and his friends there...

dreads his mortality as he walks the empty aisles of a library, admiring the volumes, yet knowing his life will never last long enough for him to enjoy them all.

Let's see how honest MY FB friends are. Leave a one word comment that you think best describes me. It can only be one word. No more than one word. Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you. This should be interesting...

wants to get out of Hyde Park.

wants to be the very best!  Like no one ever was!

A bit of Christmas cuteness: http:////www.watchanimeon.com//axis-powers-hetalia-ii-episode-28//

should just become a chef.

wonders whether love can bloom, even on a battlefield.

Merry Christmas, everyone!

Well crap.  My computer's software is currently corrupted or something and won't work.  Right before my two Hell Weeks begin.  Wheeee...  Anyone in Chicago have a copy of their Windows XP Professional edition CD I can borrow to reinstall stuff?

Is back in Chicago!

s New Year's Resolution is to negate everyone else's resolutions.

Geez 18th Century Britons, if you love *PROPNAME* the Great so much, why don't you just marry him?

Holy crap!  Hiero II of Syracuse was a former general of Pyrrhus of Epirus!  I never knew that!  Hiero has the official title of Awesomest Friendhaver in the Ancient World now, so far as I'm concerned.  Pyrrhus and Archimedes, at least!  Go Hiero!  You're MY hero!

Can't wait for next weekend, even if he is getting evaluated!

You can ask me one question (Send it to my inbox). Any question- anything. No matter how awkward it can be I'll answer it honestly, no catch. But, I dare you to put this as your status and see what people ask you.  (I can't resist dares...)

Off to the art museum!  Sorry Proposal, I'll work on you later...probably...

Whutta whutta whutta whutta...

wishes a Happy Valentine's Day to all those for whom he cares!  I hope all my friends know how much they mean to me!

Is looking forward to the weekend.

Is off to see *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*!  And I got an awesome gift in the mail today!  And I learned how to construct a book wheel.  Today is just, like, mega-awesome!

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text contains a mix of positive and negative emotions, such as excitement about buying new shoes and frustration about being sick and the weather. The use of emoticons like ": )" and ": (" indicates a range of emotional expressions. The presence of such emotional expressions suggests a person who is open about their feelings, which is more characteristic of an extraverted personality. This is somewhat opposite to my own personality, which tends to be more reserved and less expressive of emotions.

2. Cognition
- The text reflects some cognitive engagement, particularly in the humorous and reflective comment about taking a taxi if one can't walk in heels, attributed to Coco Chanel. There is also some observational thinking about the weather and its impact. However, the cognitive elements are not deeply analytical or problem-solving in nature, indicating a more casual and immediate thought process. This level of cognitive engagement does not strongly align with my own preference for deeper, more contemplative thinking.

3. Sociality
- The text shows a significant degree of social interaction, with references to going to the movies, receiving texts from others, and engaging with the "facebook generation." The use of social pronouns and expressions of gratitude towards others' concern indicates a person who values social connections and interactions. This is more typical of an extraverted individual, which contrasts with my own preference for solitude and minimal social engagement.

Overall, the person who wrote the text appears to be more extraverted than I am, as evidenced by their emotional expressiveness, social interactions, and openness to engaging with others.

needs to just calm down, take things one step at a time and remember that its her life and nobody else's.

"I think we should give our new logo to U of M, it should probably be able to coach their football team better than RichRod." LOL... seriously

Text: is wondering how many people know that the United States' Independence Day is actually the day that they published the Declaration of Independence, not the day they signed it into law.

wishes that someone would ask her what she wanted to do for once, instead of having everyone just tell her what they want her to do. : //

is hoping this week will be better than the last.

I seriously wonder why her body decides now of all times to get sick.

is excited for the long weekend and the first football game of the season! Go State!!

is glad the week is pretty much half over.

"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former." -Einstein

it will be a long week....

R.I.P. *PROPNAME*, you will be missed...

is excited! I just bought tickets for the Izzone Reunion game.... going back to relive the good ol' days!

cannot express how glad she is that it is finally friday.

"MSU caught a wolverine. They hit it with a shovel and painted it GREEN!" Lol!

Whats with all this white stuff??

needs to just calm down, take things one step at a time and remember that its her life and nobody else's.

"I think we should give our new logo to U of M, it should probably be able to coach their football team better than RichRod." LOL... seriously

Going off to kick my own ass at the gym once more.... For better or worse, this type of masochism is highly addictive

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text displays a range of emotions, from excitement and anticipation ("excited for the long weekend," "excited! I just bought tickets") to frustration and sadness ("wishes that someone would ask her what she wanted," "R.I.P. *PROPNAME*, you will be missed"). The presence of both positive and negative emotions suggests a person who experiences and expresses their feelings openly, which is more indicative of an extroverted personality. This differs from my own tendency to keep emotions more subdued and private.

2. Cognition
- The text includes instances of active thinking and reflection, such as wondering about historical facts ("wondering how many people know that the United States' Independence Day...") and quoting Einstein, which shows intellectual engagement. This suggests a cognitive openness and curiosity, traits that can be found in both introverted and extroverted individuals. However, the humorous and critical tone in some statements ("I think we should give our new logo to U of M...") may indicate a more extroverted inclination towards sharing thoughts and opinions openly.

3. Sociality
- The text contains numerous references to social activities and interactions, such as attending games, expressing desires for social consideration ("wishes that someone would ask her what she wanted"), and using humor in social contexts. The frequent use of social pronouns and relational terms suggests a person who is engaged with others and enjoys social interactions, which aligns with extroverted traits. This contrasts with my preference for solitude and minimal social engagement.

Overall, the person who wrote the text appears to be more extroverted compared to my own introverted nature. They express emotions openly, engage actively in social contexts, and share their thoughts and opinions with others, all of which are characteristic of an extroverted personality.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions
- The text displays a wide range of emotions, from excitement ("all of a sudden I'm really REALLY excited for Christmas <3") to frustration ("oh god... baby next door wont stop crying grrrr!!"). The frequent use of exclamation marks and expressions of love and excitement suggest a person who experiences emotions intensely and is not hesitant to express them. This emotional expressiveness is more aligned with extraversion, as introverted individuals, like myself, tend to be more reserved in expressing emotions.

2. Cognition
- The text includes references to intellectual engagement and active thinking, such as reading books, watching documentaries, and discussing historical and scientific topics ("I have *PROPNAME* on the brain. ugh... one of these days I will remember to write about a topic other than intellectuals in colonial eras.... UGH"). This indicates a cognitive curiosity and engagement, which can be present in both introverted and extraverted individuals. However, the frequent sharing of these thoughts with others suggests a more extraverted tendency to communicate and discuss ideas openly.

3. Sociality
- The text is rich with social interactions and invitations for others to join in activities ("is at the beach at 30th st in newport... come join! give me a call or just show up! :)"). There are numerous references to friends, family, and social events, indicating a strong inclination towards social engagement and a preference for being around others. This is a clear contrast to my own preference for solitude and limited social interaction, highlighting a more extraverted personality.

Overall, the person who wrote the text appears to be more extraverted than I am, as evidenced by their emotional expressiveness, cognitive engagement with others, and frequent social interactions.
