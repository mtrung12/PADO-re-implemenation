**Conscientiousness**
1. Emotions
- The user expresses a mix of positive emotions such as excitement, joy, love, and gratitude, but also hints at feelings of overwhelm and jitteriness.
2. Cognition
- The user seems to have a scattered thought process, jumping from one topic to another without a clear focus. There are mentions of upcoming events, observations, and reflections, but they lack a cohesive structure.
3. Sociality
- The user references interactions with others, such as attending weddings, spending time with friends and family, and expressing gratitude for birthday wishes. There is a sense of social engagement and connection throughout the text.

In terms of Conscientiousness, the user appears to be quite different from me. While I lack ambition, self-control, and tend to make reckless decisions without considering consequences, the user seems to have a more active and engaged approach to life, participating in various social activities and events. Their expression of gratitude and enjoyment of social interactions contrasts with my tendency to live in the moment without much thought for the future.

You are a comparative agent responsible for comparing the analyses of two
explainers and determining the user’s personality.
Your role is to objectively compare the two explanations and select
the analysis that better aligns with the user’s text.


--- USER PROMPT ---

Follow these steps to perform your analysis:
1. Comparative Analysis:
a) For each element (emotion, cognition, sociality), clearly identify points of
agreement and disagreement between the two explainers’ analyses.
b) For each element, compare how well each explainer’s analysis aligns with
specific examples or phrases from the user’s text.
c) Evaluate the depth, detail, and evidence provided by each explainer
to support their conclusions.
2. Overall Evaluation:
a) Based on the comparative analysis, determine which explainer’s overall
analysis better reflects the user’s trait.
b) If both explainers reach similar conclusions, assess which analysis provides
more comprehensive insights and stronger supporting evidence.
3. Final Judgement: Conclude whether the user’s trait is high or low, and briefly
explain your reasoning based on the stronger analysis.
