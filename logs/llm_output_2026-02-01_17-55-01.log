What a fascinating text! Based on the given text, I'm going to analyze the personality of the person who wrote it. As I'm a friendly and gregarious person, I'll use my own personality traits as a reference.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions: The text expresses a mix of emotions, including excitement, happiness, and enthusiasm. The use of words like "Woo Hoo," "Happy Birthday," and "I love you" indicates a strong positive emotional tone. This suggests that the person is an extroverted individual who enjoys social interactions and expressing their emotions openly. They likely have a high level of emotional expression and are comfortable being around others.
2. Cognition: The text doesn't reveal much about the person's cognitive abilities or intellectual engagement. However, the use of simple and straightforward language suggests that the person might not be overly concerned with complex thinking or problem-solving. They might be more focused on social interactions and emotional connections.
3. Sociality: The text is filled with social references, including birthday wishes, greetings, and expressions of love. The person seems to be very social and enjoys interacting with others. They use social pronouns like "I," "you," and "we," indicating a strong sense of connection with others. The text also includes references to friends, family, and special occasions, which suggests a strong social network.

Comparing the person's personality to mine, I'd say we share a similar level of extraversion. We both enjoy being around others, expressing our emotions openly, and engaging in social interactions. However, I'd say the person might be slightly more focused on emotional expression and social connections, whereas I'm more focused on intellectual engagement and new experiences. Overall, I'd say the person is a social butterfly who thrives in social situations and values strong relationships.

Based on the given text, I predict that the person who wrote it is likely to be an extroverted individual. Here's my analysis:

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions: The text expresses a mix of emotions, including excitement, joy, and gratitude. The use of words like "Woo Hoo", "Happy Birthday", and "I love you" suggests a strong emotional expression, which is typical of extroverted individuals who tend to be more expressive and outgoing.
2. Cognition: The text does not reveal much about the person's cognitive processes, as it is mostly composed of emotional expressions and social interactions. However, the use of rhetorical questions and exclamations suggests a more impulsive and spontaneous thinking style, which is characteristic of extroverted individuals.
3. Sociality: The text is heavily focused on social interactions, with numerous references to friends, family, and celebrations. The use of social pronouns like "I", "you", and "we" indicates a strong emphasis on social relationships and a desire to connect with others. The text also includes expressions of gratitude and affection, which suggests a strong need for social validation and approval.

In comparison to my own personality traits, I am an introverted individual who tends to be more reserved and less expressive. I am more likely to analyze and reflect on my emotions before expressing them, whereas the person who wrote this text seems to be more spontaneous and impulsive in their emotional expressions.

RIP *PROPNAME*...

Walked out this morning, dont believe what I saw | A Hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore | Seems Im not alone at being alone | A Hundred billion castaways, looking for a home...

You always knew just how to make me cry | And never did I ask you questions why | It seems you get your kicks from hurting me | Don't try to understand me | Because your words just aren't enough | Love is a feeling | Give it when I want it | Quench my des

Tokyo.

went out for dinner with a man who just happened to be a host.  True story.

Hey all!  My American Phone is officially off!  Don't call or text it anymore, k?

And we can live in a beautiful world hide away under peaceful skies. We can survive on time and a word feel the nights passing by.

I've finally gotten around to uploading all of my Japan pictures so far.  I know there are an unbelievable amount of them (forgive me, I love taking pics), but enjoy them!

ALLIANCE, n. In international politics, the union of two thieves who have their hands so deeply inserted in each other’s pockets that they cannot separately plunder a third.

missed teaching at the elementary school Thursday...  -sad-

wants to fall in love~

Woke up late and didn't get to eat breakfast today -sad- I'm so hungry...

I want someone to buy me dinner.

"The greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy, to drive him before you, to see his cities reduced to ashes, to see those who love him shrouded in tears, and to gather into your bosom his wives and daughters."

I always make it a rule to let the other fellow fire first.  If a man wants to fight, I argue the question with him and try to show him how foolish it would be.  If he can't be dissuaded, why then the fun begins but I always let him have first crack.  Then when I fire, you see, I have the verdict of self-defence on my side.  I know that he is pretty certain in his hurry, to miss.  I never do.

I want to be loved, but you don't seem to love me | I'm wandering aimlessly within this repetition | And the answer I found is only one; that even if I'm scared, even if I'm hurt | I'll say "I love you" to the person I love

So bored.

“?????” ???????? ???????? You and I ???? ??????? ????? ???????????? ???????? “I want to see you” right now! Even though I want to shout it. I no longer can say “you and I” Even if I try to force it. I can’t catch you Back then you used to be in my armsBut you’re gone now.

is missing you.

"In the absence of orders, find something and kill it."   -*PROPNAME*

"I have a ship and a fighting crew and a girl with lips like wine, and that's all I ever asked.  Lick your wounds, bullies, and break out a cask of ale.  You're going to work ship as she never was worked before.  Dance and sing while you buckle to it, damn you! To the devil with empty seas! We're bound for waters where the seaports are fat, and the merchant ships are crammed with plunder!"

Lupin, like Mr. Huttle, has original and sometimes wonderful ideas; but it is those ideas that are so dangerous. They make men extremely rich or extremely poor. They make or break men. I always feel people are happier who live a simple unsophisticated life. I believe I am happy because I am not ambitious.

Like fire, Hellfire,  This fire in my skin.        This burning, desire,         Is turning me to sin.  | It's not my fault; I'm not to blame.   It is the gypsy girl; The witch who sent this flame  | It's not my fault; If in God's plan.  He made the devil so much stronger than a man

La~st Christmas, I gave you my heart.  The very next day, you gave it away... This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

I hope the survivors in Haiti receive aid quickly...

I will be in Tokyo on the 10th!  Anyone want to entertain//be entertained by me while I'm there?

I like Asahi Super Dry... very much.

Your face.

Slowly walking down the hall, Faster than a cannonball~  Where were you while we were getting high? Someday you will find me, Caught beneath the landslide, In a champagne supernova in the sky~~~

Will be in Tokyo all of Wednesday morning~ Does anyone want to hang out?

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions: The text expresses a mix of emotions, including sadness, anger, frustration, and longing. The writer seems to be struggling with emotional pain and hurt, but also shows a desire for love and connection. The tone is often melancholic and introspective, with a hint of bitterness and resentment.
2. Cognition: The text reveals a high level of intellectual engagement, with complex ideas and metaphors used to express emotions and thoughts. The writer appears to be a creative and imaginative person, with a strong desire to communicate their feelings and ideas.
3. Sociality: The text is highly social, with a focus on relationships and interactions with others. The writer seems to be craving human connection and intimacy, but also expresses frustration and hurt due to past experiences. The use of social pronouns and relational terms, such as "you" and "I," suggests a strong desire for social interaction and connection.

Based on these elements, I would say that the writer is likely an introverted person, as they seem to be more focused on their internal emotions and thoughts rather than external social interactions. However, the text also reveals a strong desire for connection and intimacy, which suggests that the writer may be more introverted than extroverted.

In comparison to my own personality, I would say that the writer is more introverted and emotionally sensitive than I am. While I am a friendly and outgoing person, the writer seems to be more reserved and introspective. However, both of us share a strong desire for connection and intimacy, and a willingness to express our emotions and thoughts through creative means.

1. Emotions: The text expresses a mix of negative emotions such as sadness, anger, and frustration, as well as a sense of longing and desire. The tone is often melancholic and introspective, with a focus on the speaker's emotional pain and struggles. This suggests that the person is likely introverted and may not be comfortable expressing their emotions openly.
2. Cognition: The text shows a high level of intellectual engagement, with complex ideas and metaphors used to express the speaker's thoughts and feelings. The use of literary references and poetic language suggests a high level of cognitive ability and a strong interest in intellectual pursuits.
3. Sociality: The text reveals a desire for social connection and intimacy, but also a sense of isolation and disconnection. The speaker expresses a longing for love and connection, but also a fear of being hurt or rejected. This suggests that the person may be introverted and may struggle with social interactions.

Based on these findings, I would say that the person who wrote this text is likely introverted, with a strong preference for introspection and self-reflection. They may be more comfortable expressing themselves through writing or art than through direct social interaction.

Woke up late and didn't get to eat breakfast today -sad- I'm so hungry...

I want someone to buy me dinner.

"The greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy, to drive him before you, to see his cities reduced to ashes, to see those who love him shrouded in tears, and to gather into your bosom his wives and daughters."

I always make it a rule to let the other fellow fire first.  If a man wants to fight, I argue the question with him and try to show him how foolish it would be.  If he can't be dissuaded, why then the fun begins but I always let him have first crack.  Then when I fire, you see, I have the verdict of self-defence on my side.  I know that he is pretty certain in his hurry, to miss.  I never do.

I want to be loved, but you don't seem to love me | I'm wandering aimlessly within this repetition | And the answer I found is only one; that even if I'm scared, even if I'm hurt | I'll say "I love you" to the person I love

So bored.

“?????” ???????? ???????? You and I ???? ??????? ????? ???????????? ???????? “I want to see you” right now! Even though I want to shout it. I no longer can say “you and I” Even if I try to force it. I can’t catch you Back then you used to be in my armsBut you’re gone now.

is missing you.

"In the absence of orders, find something and kill it."   -*PROPNAME*

"I have a ship and a fighting crew and a girl with lips like wine, and that's all I ever asked.  Lick your wounds, bullies, and break out a cask of ale.  You're going to work ship as she never was worked before.  Dance and sing while you buckle to it, damn you! To the devil with empty seas! We're bound for waters where the seaports are fat, and the merchant ships are crammed with plunder!"

Lupin, like Mr. Huttle, has original and sometimes wonderful ideas; but it is those ideas that are so dangerous. They make men extremely rich or extremely poor. They make or break men. I always feel people are happier who live a simple unsophisticated life. I believe I am happy because I am not ambitious.

Like fire, Hellfire,  This fire in my skin.        This burning, desire,         Is turning me to sin.  | It's not my fault; I'm not to blame.   It is the gypsy girl; The witch who sent this flame  | It's not my fault; If in God's plan.  He made the devil so much stronger than a man

La~st Christmas, I gave you my heart.  The very next day, you gave it away... This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

I hope the survivors in Haiti receive aid quickly...

I will be in Tokyo on the 10th!  Anyone want to entertain//be entertained by me while I'm there?

I like Asahi Super Dry... very much.

Your face.

Slowly walking down the hall, Faster than a cannonball~  Where were you while we were getting high? Someday you will find me, Caught beneath the landslide, In a champagne supernova in the sky~~~

Will be in Tokyo all of Wednesday morning~ Does anyone want to hang out?
Explainer A: **Extraversion**

1. Emotions: The text expresses a mix of negative emotions such as sadness, anger, and frustration, as well as a sense of longing and desire. The tone is often melancholic and introspective, with a focus on the speaker's emotional pain and struggles. This suggests that the person is likely introverted and may not be comfortable expressing their emotions openly.
2. Cognition: The text shows a high level of intellectual engagement, with complex ideas and metaphors used to express the speaker's thoughts and feelings. The use of literary references and poetic language suggests a high level of cognitive ability and a strong interest in intellectual pursuits.
3. Sociality: The text reveals a desire for social connection and intimacy, but also a sense of isolation and disconnection. The speaker expresses a longing for love and connection, but also a fear of being hurt or rejected. This suggests that the person may be introverted and may struggle with social interactions.

Based on these findings, I would say that the person who wrote this text is likely introverted, with a strong preference for introspection and self-reflection. They may be more comfortable expressing themselves through writing or art than through direct social interaction.
Explainer B: **Extraversion**

1. Emotions: The text expresses a mix of emotions, including sadness, anger, frustration, and longing. The writer seems to be struggling with emotional pain and hurt, but also shows a desire for love and connection. The tone is often melancholic and introspective, with a hint of bitterness and resentment.
2. Cognition: The text reveals a high level of intellectual engagement, with complex ideas and metaphors used to express emotions and thoughts. The writer appears to be a creative and imaginative person, with a strong desire to communicate their feelings and ideas.
3. Sociality: The text is highly social, with a focus on relationships and interactions with others. The writer seems to be craving human connection and intimacy, but also expresses frustration and hurt due to past experiences. The use of social pronouns and relational terms, such as "you" and "I," suggests a strong desire for social interaction and connection.

Based on these elements, I would say that the writer is likely an introverted person, as they seem to be more focused on their internal emotions and thoughts rather than external social interactions. However, the text also reveals a strong desire for connection and intimacy, which suggests that the writer may be more introverted than extroverted.

In comparison to my own personality, I would say that the writer is more introverted and emotionally sensitive than I am. While I am a friendly and outgoing person, the writer seems to be more reserved and introspective. However, both of us share a strong desire for connection and intimacy, and a willingness to express our emotions and thoughts through creative means.

Comparative Analysis:

1. Emotions: Both explainers identify the text as expressing a mix of negative emotions, including sadness, anger, and frustration.

Explainer A's analysis is more introspective, while Explainer B's is more social.
2. Cognition: Both explainers identify the text as showing a high level of intellectual engagement, with complex ideas and metaphors used to express thoughts and feelings.

Overall Evaluation:

Based on the comparative analysis, I conclude that Explainer B's analysis better reflects the user's trait. Explainer B's analysis is more comprehensive, taking into account the speaker's desire for social connection and intimacy, as well as their emotional pain and struggles. Explainer A's analysis is more focused on the speaker's introspection and emotional pain, which, while important, is not the only aspect of the text.

Final Judgement:

Based on the stronger analysis, I conclude that the user's trait is likely introverted, with a strong desire for social connection and intimacy. The user may be more reserved and emotionally sensitive than others, but they also have a strong desire to express themselves creatively and connect with others.

wishes the Boy Scouts of America a very Happy 100th Birthday today!

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions: The text expresses a mix of emotions, including happiness, excitement, and gratitude. The writer seems to enjoy sharing their experiences and thoughts with others, as evident in the birthday wishes and the excitement about their son's new baby. However, there is also a sense of tiredness and exhaustion, which might indicate a need for alone time. Overall, the emotions expressed are generally positive, but not overly enthusiastic or outgoing.
2. Cognition: The text shows a moderate level of cognitive engagement, with the writer sharing their thoughts and plans, as well as reflecting on their experiences. However, the language used is not overly complex or intellectually stimulating, suggesting a more laid-back and easy-going approach to thinking.
3. Sociality: The text reveals a moderate level of sociality, with the writer engaging with others through various forms of communication (e.g., Facebook, birthday wishes). The writer also shares their personal experiences and thoughts, indicating a willingness to connect with others. However, the tone is not overly social or outgoing, suggesting a preference for more intimate and low-key interactions.

Comparing this analysis to my own personality traits, I would say that the writer is more outgoing and sociable than I am. While I am an introvert, the writer seems to enjoy sharing their thoughts and experiences with others, and is more comfortable engaging in social interactions. However, the writer's emotions and cognitive processes are not as intense or complex as mine, which might indicate a more laid-back and easy-going approach to life.

We are both outgoing and sociable, and we value social connections and communication. However, I would say that the writer is slightly more reserved in their emotions, as they don't express as much anger or frustration as I do.

What a delightful task!

Based on the given text, I'm going to analyze the personality of the person who wrote it. As a friendly and gregarious person myself, I'll use my own personality traits as a reference.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions: The text expresses gratitude and appreciation, which indicates a positive emotional tone. The use of "special thanks" and the enthusiastic tone suggest a warm and friendly demeanor. This aligns with my own outgoing and sociable nature. I'd say the writer is likely an extravert, as they seem to enjoy expressing their emotions and connecting with others.
2. Cognition: The text jumps straight into the literature review, which implies a logical and organized thinking process. The writer appears to be focused on their task and is not afraid to dive into complex ideas. This cognitive style is similar to my own, as I'm always eager to engage in intellectual discussions and explore new ideas.
3. Sociality: The text includes a mention of "PROPNAME" and "PROPNAME", which suggests a sense of community and collaboration. The writer is acknowledging the help and support of others, which indicates a strong social connection. This aligns with my own love for being around others and building relationships.

Overall, I believe the writer is likely an extravert, as they exhibit a positive emotional tone, logical thinking, and a strong social connection. They seem to enjoy interacting with others, expressing their emotions, and engaging in intellectual discussions.

Based on the given text, I predict that the person who wrote it is likely to be an introverted individual, similar to me. Here's my analysis:

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions: The text does not express any strong emotions, neither positive nor negative. The tone is neutral and formal, indicating a lack of emotional intensity. This suggests that the writer is not an outgoing or emotional person, which aligns with my own introverted nature.
2. Cognition: The text is focused on the literature review, indicating a high level of intellectual engagement and attention to detail. The writer seems to be thorough and meticulous in their analysis, which is a characteristic of introverted individuals who tend to be detail-oriented and analytical.
3. Sociality: The text does not contain any references to social interactions, friends, or family. The writer's gratitude is expressed through a formal acknowledgement of others' contributions, which suggests a polite and courteous demeanor, but not necessarily a strong desire for social interaction. This lack of social references is consistent with my own preference for solitude and avoidance of being the center of attention.

Overall, based on the text, I believe the writer is likely an introverted individual who values intellectual pursuits and prefers to focus on their own thoughts and analysis rather than seeking social interaction.

What a fascinating text! Based on this, I'm going to analyze the personality of the person who wrote it. As I'm a friendly and outgoing person myself, I'll use my own personality traits as a reference.

**Extraversion**

1. Emotions: The text expresses a mix of positive and negative emotions, indicating a dynamic and lively personality. The writer seems to be a happy and optimistic person, as they mention "happy" and "Merry Christmas!" several times. However, they also express frustration ("is mad at himself") and annoyance ("is sick of data"). This suggests that they're not afraid to show their emotions and are willing to be vulnerable.
2. Cognition: The text reveals a curious and analytical mind. The writer is interested in various topics, such as math (GRE scores), science (correlation coefficients), and technology (Ipod, Tap Tap Revenge). They also mention a Nobel Prize in literature, indicating an appreciation for intellectual pursuits.
3. Sociality: The text is filled with references to social interactions, such as "has great friends," "is happy his brother will join him in Princeton," and "is coming back." The writer seems to value relationships and is excited about social events, like interviews at prestigious universities.

Comparing this to my own personality, I'd say that the writer is more introverted than me. While I'm a social butterfly, the writer seems to be more reserved and focused on their own interests. However, they still have a strong desire for social connections and interactions, which is evident in their enthusiasm for sharing their experiences and thoughts with others.

Overall, the writer appears to be a curious, analytical, and sociable person who values intellectual pursuits and relationships. They're not afraid to express their emotions and are willing to be vulnerable, which is a great quality!
